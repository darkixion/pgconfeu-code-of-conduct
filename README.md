pgconfeu-code-of-conduct
=====================

This is a "fork" of the PyCon code of conduct including the staff and attendee
guides.

We will be maintaining the code of conduct in a public Git repository for ease
of review as we will be seeking input from multiple parties.

This code of conduct will be tagged on a yearly basis to make clear what the
final code is for each conference.  This will then be agree by the conference
chair and published on the main conference website.

We hope, as a team we can iterate and improve continually.
